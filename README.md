# ONLINE-BUS-BOOKING-MYSQL
 
The Online Bus Booking System project aims to develop a comprehensive database schema that facilitates the management of bus ticket bookings. The schema is designed to include several key tables: users, which stores user information; categories, which classifies different types of bus services; cost, which details the pricing for various routes; orders, which tracks user bookings; and query, which manages customer inquiries. This structured approach ensures that the system can efficiently handle user data, process bookings, and respond to queries, ultimately enhancing the user experience in booking bus tickets. The project emphasizes normalization to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity, making it a robust solution for online bus ticket management.
